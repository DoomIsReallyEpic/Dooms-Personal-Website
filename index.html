            <h2>Info of this Website</h2>
            <p>Hello I'm Doom and I made this website so I could further expand my coding skills and web design in general!! 
               I first used Strawpage and Google Sites as my first website makers, and it didn't click on me until like years later that I kinda like making websites, 
               so I'm basically just expanding it to coding now. I'm currently using freeCodeCamp as a way for me to learn, 
               and it has been very helpful considering I made this website as that resource as a guide. Highly recommend it!!

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>As I've mentioned above, I'm currently trying to learn making this website right now. It's basically my top project priority at the moment!! 
               I also make other shit in my youtube channel, but they are mostly jokes or whatsoever. I will maybe switch to making videos if my channel ever gets popular, 
               but of course I'll still learn to make a website as a side thing. Other than that I just make variety content basically.

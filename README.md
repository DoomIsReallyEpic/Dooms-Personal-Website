# Doom's Personal Website Info
This is my personal website that I made for fun, and also just to learn stuff as I want to become a Web Developer. 
The concept of being a Web Developer didn't really click on me until in late 2025 where I realized I liked it!! 
I even made 2 wiki sites (Both on Google Sites) and a StrawPage before this whole Web Developer thing, which was basically a few years ago. It just didn't click on me until now!!
I'm basically just pretty much expanding my own StrawPage to this website now, as there's much more stuff to do when making your own website.
I'm currently using freeCodeCamp as a way to learn, and after I'm done with that I'll probably try to look for something else that can help better my skills in Web Development.

## How It's Made
Currently, this website is made of HTML and CSS.

I plan to incorporate Java into this website eventually so I could make some cool stuff or apps with it and insert it to my own website as a category.

## Contact
You can contact me using the Links page in the website itself. I would prefer adding me on Discord!

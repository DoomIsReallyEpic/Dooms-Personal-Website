# Doom's Personal Website Info
This is my personal website that I made for fun, and also just to learn stuff as I want to become a web developer.

Link to website: https://doomernuts.neocities.org/

## How It's Made
Currently, this website is made of HTML and CSS.

I plan to incorporate Java into this website eventually so I could make some cool stuff or apps with it and insert it to my own website as a category.

## Contact
You can contact me using the Links page in the website itself. I would prefer adding me on Discord!

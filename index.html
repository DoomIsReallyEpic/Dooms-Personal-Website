            <h2>Website Info</h2>
            <p>
               This is my personal website that I made for fun, and also just to learn stuff as I want to become a Web Developer. 
               The concept of being a Web Developer didn't really click on me until in late 2025 where I realized I liked it!! 
               I even made 2 wiki sites (Both on Google Sites) and a StrawPage before this whole Web Developer thing, which was basically a few years ago. It just didn't click on me until now!!
               I'm basically just pretty much expanding my own StrawPage to this website now, as there's much more stuff to do when making your own website.
               I'm currently using freeCodeCamp as a way to learn, and after I'm done with that I'll probably try to look for something else that can help better my skills in Web Development.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
               As I've mentioned above, I'm currently trying to learn making this website right now. It's basically my top project priority at the moment!! 
               I also make other shit in my youtube channel, but they are mostly jokes or whatsoever. I will maybe switch to making videos if my channel ever gets popular, 
               but of course I'll still learn to make a website as a side thing. Other than that I just make variety content basically.
